# The case of an online grocery store

For this project, research was conducted for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. The goal was to uncover more information about their sales patterns.

As if I had to work with the large amount of data, it was decided to conduct an analysis and visualization using python and Jupyter notebook.
